# 🕯️ Advent of Code 2023 in modern PHP 🕯️

I tried to keep the code as simple as possible, so it's not the most efficient solution.<br>
I want it to be easy to understand for beginners. Code duplication is intended in some cases<br>
to make it easier to understand the code.

## Requirements

-   PHP >= 8.1
-   Composer

## Usage

```bash
composer install
php bin/console solve <day>
```

I add days as I solve them, so not all days are available yet.
